This is a set of movies, collected into lists, and represented just as plain
text.

It's something cooler people would track in tract.tv or one of those kinds of
services, but I'm tired of those services disappearing and taking my movie
ratings and collections away with them.

So here it goes, in the simplest way possible.

FAQ
---

* There's a movie you may like.

    Send a PR please!

* Your taste in movies is bad.

    Send PR to fix please.

* What is "shut off"?

    Those are the only movies I ever shut off mid-way through given how
    unentertained I was. Usually I like finishing things, even if they're
    mediocre.
